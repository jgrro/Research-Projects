## 1. Problem Definition
The subjects of focus in this research are Kean University students. Kean University is a public post-secondary institution in New Jersey. It is known for its outstanding achievements and forward-thinking approach in the realm of higher education, specifically within the domains of business, healthcare, and technology. Its six undergraduate colleges, which include the College of Business and Public Management, the College of Education, the College of Liberal Arts, the Dorothy and George Hennings College of Science, Mathematics and Technology, Michael Graves College, and the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology, and Mathematics, collectively provide a diverse selection of over 50 undergraduate degree programs across a wide spectrum of academic disciplines. Likewise, Kean offers six doctoral degree programs and more than seventy options for graduate study leading to master’s degrees, professional diplomas, or certifications.
Kean University is concerned about the rise in students' lateness, as reported by faculty members. The observable symptom is an increasing number of students arriving late to their classes. The underlying problem causing this observational symptom is the insufficient time for students to commute from one building to another during their scheduled classes since the distance between campus buildings can be up to 0.7 miles. Students encounter challenges in commuting within the limited break time, impacting their academic performance; this issue is particularly significant due to Kean University's student attendance policy, which requires attendance in all courses and includes attendance as a graded component of any course if stated in the syllabus. 

## 2. Research Purpose
The research project aims to identify the underlying causes of increased student lateness at Kean University by identifying the root causes of the observable symptoms reported by faculty members — specifically, the insufficient time students have to commute between campus buildings during scheduled classes, particularly when facing distances of up to 0.7 miles. Therefore, this research seeks to collect data through an online survey questionnaire from Kean University students attending classes on the east campus (Hynes Hall, Liberty Hall, Enlow Hall, and other main campus buildings.) This group serves as the primary source of information, being directly affected by the problem. Since this research strives to understand students' mobility, it seeks to develop and implement an effective marketing strategy in response to the identified problem. The proposed strategy involves introducing E-Scooter rental services, targeting Kean students. This initiative is designed to meet the needs of Kean students, although faculty and staff could also benefit, by enhancing campus mobility and improved punctuality. Ultimately, it aims to contribute valuable insights for tailoring impactful solutions, addressing the following research questions: (1) What causes students lateness in class? (2) How does lateness influence students' performance? (3) How will an E-Scooter positively impact their mobility?


## 3. Hypotheses

### 3.1- Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1: The time it takes to get from one class building to the next  significantly contributes to students’ lateness to classes.
The choice of this hypothesis is based on the problem definition provided. The observable symptom of increased students' lateness is attributed to insufficient time for commuting between campus buildings during scheduled classes. Distances of up to 0.7 miles indicate a relationship between the time it takes to commute from one class building to another and students' punctuality. Therefore, this hypothesis aims to explore whether the time taken to commute contributes significantly to students’ lateness to classes.

Hypothesis 2: Lateness negatively impacts students' academic performance. 
This hypothesis is based on the problem definition provided, emphasizing the impact of student lateness on their academic performance. The information gathered states that lateness is considered a significant issue due to Kean University’s attendance policy, which includes attendance as a graded component of any course. Therefore, this hypothesis seeks to quantify and understand the potential consequences of student lateness to classes. 

Hypothesis 3: Introducing E-scooter rental services will improve punctuality and mobility. 
This hypothesis is based on the proposal strategy, the introduction of E-Scooter rental services as a solution to the identified problem. The hypothesis suggests that providing alternative mobility solutions, such as e-scooters, could positively impact student punctuality by addressing the commuting challenges highlighted in the problem definition. Thus, this hypothesis arises from the proposal strategy, seeking to understand the mobility needs of students as an innovative solution to the observed problem. 

### 3.2- Null and alternative for each hypothesis

Hypothesis 1
H0: The time it takes to get from one class building to the next will not have a significant impact on students' lateness.
H1: The time it takes to get from one class building to the next will have a significant impact on students' lateness.

Hypothesis 2
H0: Lateness to class will not have a significant negative impact on academic performance. 
H1: Lateness to class will have a significant negative impact on academic performance.

Hypothesis 3
 H0: The introduction of E-Scooters rental services on Kean University campus will not have a significant impact on reducing student lateness to classes. 
H1: The introduction of E-Scooter rental services on Kean Students campus will have a significant impact on reducing student lateness to classes.

## 4. Research Method

### 4.1        Primary Data Collection
To obtain the information needed for our research project, we gathered data on students’ mobility patterns, including average commute times and frequency of lateness. This information will also provide insights into where e-scooter docking stations should be strategically placed. The data method chosen for our project is a survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire will be conducted to determine the level of importance of students’ mobility. This survey questionnaire will provide insights into the impact of e-scooter adoption. We used Google Forms to create our survey questionnaire and distributed it to our respondents through email.

### 4.2- Sampling Collection 
        The data sample for this research project is Kean University students with commuting issues regarding the time to get to class. This group represents the primary source of information since they will be directly impacted by the introduction of e-scooters on campus. Our sample pool is appropriate for our research problem because some students on East Campus don’t have vehicles, and the shuttle takes a long time to transport them to their destination. For students that have cars on East Campus, traffic and finding parking are factors in why they are sometimes late for class. Through this method, we acquired 50 respondents for our research project. 

## 5. Data Analysis and Results

### 5.1 Description of descriptive statistics 

The dataset, derived from 50 Kean University students experiencing commuting difficulties between classes, sheds light on mobility patterns and perceptions related to academic performance, commute times, lateness, e-scooter usage, and its anticipated impact. The mean score for Academic Performance (Q8) is 2.8, with a median and mode of 3. This suggests a tendency towards moderate performance levels among respondents. The standard deviation of 1.1780 indicates a notable spread in academic performance within the sample. Regarding Time Between Buildings (Q9), the mean is 2.18, with a median and mode of 2. This suggests that, on average, students perceive a moderate time required to move between buildings, with a relatively consistent distribution around this average, as indicated by the standard deviation of 0.8497. Lateness (Q10) has a mean of 1.96, with a median and mode of 2. This suggests that students sometimes experience lateness, likely due to various factors impacting their commute between classes. The standard deviation of 0.6987 shows some variability in lateness among respondents. E-Scooter (Q12) shows a mean of 3.36, with a median of 3 and a mode of 5. This suggests a moderate level of interest or usage of e-scooters among respondents. The standard deviation of 1.4813 indicates some variability in the extent of e-scooter use. Finally, E-scooter Impact (Q13) has a mean of 3.96, a median of 4, and a mode of 5. This suggests that respondents generally perceive a significant positive impact of e-scooter adoption on their mobility, with a relatively narrow spread indicated by the standard deviation of 1.0490.
  


### 5.2 Analysis techniques 

**Hypothesis 1 - Results**
In our study, we used simple regression to see if "students' lateness" could be predicted by "commute time between buildings." This helps gauge if longer commutes notably contribute to students being late for classes. The regression model is  Lateness = a + β1(Time Between Buildings), indicates the impact of commute time on lateness. This analysis helps determine if commute time between majors is a major factor in students' Lateness. If it shows a significant relationship, it supports the idea that longer commutes lead to more Lateness. If not, it suggests other factors might be more critical in students being late, prompting further investigation.

  

**Hypothesis 2 - Results**
In our study, we used simple regression to explore whether "students' lateness" (dependent variable) could be anticipated by "commute time between buildings" (independent variable). This investigation aims to understand if longer commutes negatively impact students' academic performance by causing them to be late for classes. The regression model is Academic performance = a + β1(Lateness). If a substantial connection emerges, it supports the notion that lateness potentially negatively affects academic performance. Conversely, if this relationship is insignificant, it suggests other factors may play a part in this prediction, prompting further exploration.

  

**Hypothesis 3 - Results**
For hypothesis number three, we employed simple regression to investigate if "reducing student lateness to classes" (dependent variable) could be predicted by "E-scooter rental services" (independent variable). The regression model developed is E-scooter Impact = a + β1(E-scooter). If the relationship appears to be strong, it suggests that the introduction of e-scooters to use on campus might indeed impact decreasing the time it takes to get to class. On the contrary, if this connection is weak, it implies other factors might contribute more, urging additional investigation into this relationship.

**5.3 Analysis of hypotheses**

**Hypothesis 1 - Analysis
Regression Model** 

 y =  a + β1(x) —-  Lateness = a + β1(Time Between Buildings)
B1 = 0.2646. Therefore, when the time between buildings increases by 1 minute, the students' lateness to class will increase by 0.2646 minutes. 
R2  Simple Regression
R2   = 0.1035

The simple regression model predicts a weaker linear relationship between x and y, indicating that the independent variable explains only a small portion of the variability in the dependent variable. Therefore, we can conclude that the majority of the variability in students' lateness is not explained by the time it takes a student to commute within class buildings since the linear relationship is relatively weak.

**Results**
At a 5% level of significance, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value for “Time Between Buildings” is 0.0227 which means that is less than alpha (0.05). Thus, we can conclude that there is a significant impact of the time it takes to get from one class building to the next on a student's lateness. 


**Hypothesis 2 - Analysis
Regression Model** 

 y =  a + β1(x) —-  Academic Performance = a + β1(Lateness)
B1 = 0.3595. Therefore, when the number of lateness increases by 1 per week, the students' academic performance will negatively be affected by 0.3595.
R2  Simple Regression
R2   = 0.0455

The simple regression model predicts a weaker linear relationship between x and y, indicating that the independent variable explains only a small portion of the variability in the dependent variable. Therefore, we can conclude that the majority of the variability in students' academic performance is not explained by the number of lateness per week since the linear relationship is relatively weak based on this model. 

**Results**
At a 5% level of significance, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value for “Number of Lateness ” is 0.1371 which means that is greater than alpha (0.05). Therefore, we can conclude that lateness to class will not have a significant negative impact on students’ academic performance.


**Hypothesis 3 - Analysis
Regression Model** 

 y =  a + β1(x) —-  E-scooters impact = a + β1(E-scooters)
B1 = 0.3136. Therefore, when the number of e-scooters increases by 1 unit, the impact on reducing students' lateness to class will increase by 0.3136.
R2  Simple Regression
R2   = 0.1961

The simple regression model suggests a moderate prediction of the level of relationship between x and y, indicating that the independent variable explains only a moderate portion of the variability in the dependent variable. Therefore, we can conclude that the other part of the variability between the introduction of e-scooters and the impact of reducing students' lateness is still unexplained by this model. 

**Results**
At a 5% level of significance, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value for “Introduction of E-scooters ” is 0.001279107, which means that is less than alpha (0.05). Therefore, we can conclude that introduction of E-scooter rental services on Kean Students campus will have a significant impact on reducing student lateness to classes.


## 6. Conclusions & Recommendations

### 6.1 Recommendations regarding proposed marketing strategy

**-Recommendation 1** 
After thoroughly analyzing the research data, we would recommend Kean University to introduce E-Scooter rental-services on campus for students to utilize. Hypothesis 1 concludes there is a direct relationship between the time it takes for students to travel from different class buildings and students being late to classes. From our research prior to conducting the analysis, it was found that the furthest distance between class buildings is 0.7 miles. Students are limited to 15 minute passing time between classes, ultimately putting the student in a position to travel across campus to reach their next designated class building in a minimal amount of time. Implementing E-Scooters on campus use would be beneficial to students who have back to back classes in different buildings on campus to ensure they are getting to class in a timely manner. To support this, our research from hypothesis 3 concludes that an E-Scooter rental service on campus would have a significant impact on decreasing the amount of students being late to class.

**-Recommendations 2** 
To further expand on our marketing strategy, we would recommend Kean University to develop a user-friendly mobility application to provide students to conveniently locate and access the E-Scooter. The application should include features such as user registration, rental selection, locations of charging hubs and scooters, and safety guidelines. These main features will help ensure the E-Scooters are utilized in a proper, but also safe way. To strategically place where the E-Scooter hubs are located, we are listening to the students' opinion. In our survey questionnaire, we asked participants “Which of the following locations would you prefer the e-scooters to be placed? (Select all that apply).” Participants were given the option of Main Campus, East Campus, and Liberty Hall Campus. Students who participated opted for all three locations, with a major emphasis on Main Campus. To cater to the students' needs, we should place the E-Scooter hubs on Main Campus, Liberty Hall, and East Campus (Hynes Hall and Enlow Hall). Students will be able to locate the nearest E-Scooter to them through the app. Providing students with several hubs around campus and an easy to use app will allow for a more seamless experience for students and ultimately cut down travel time. 

**-Recommendation 3**
Our final recommendation after conducting research is for Kean University to form a partnership with an E-Scooter business, such as Spin. Spin is a E-Scooter company that is partnered with more than 28 universities in the US. Their mission is to transform campuses and communities by providing accessible, affordable and sustainable forms of transportation. Spin Hubs are said to keep the scooters both organized and charged to ensure the most amount of availability for students. They also value safety in their products as well as the participants of our questionnaire. On a scale of “not important” to “extremely important”, the majority of participants chose “important”, “very important” and "extremely important" for their answers. Spins mission and values directly correlate with the vision we see for Kean University students. We want to provide students with a convenient and easy solution to being late for class on our large campus. A partnership with Spin would be beneficial to achieve our goal of the use of E-Scooters on campus to decrease the amount of students who are late for their classes.  

### 6.2 Limitations.

One limitation for ours was a small sample size. The population of Kean is about 12,000 students, and we only had 50 respondents. This small sample size may compromise data and information that could have created better recommendations. Our research method was only a survey, and we distributed it to other Kean students through their school email as this was a free, convenient and time friendly way to collect data. In the future, we can conduct an additional survey to obtain more data pertaining to students spending habits on campus. We can send these surveys through email and have physical copies at Kean’s student halls, dorms, dining halls and library as that can increase our sample size. Our hypotheses 1 and 3 conclude that E-scooters benefit students by reducing their lateness to class, so additional research would determine if they are willing to pay for the services.
